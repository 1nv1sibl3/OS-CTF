MY DEAREST CECILIA SCHARIAC,
AS I SIT HERE, PEN IN HAND, MY HEART OVERFLOWS WITH EMOTIONS THAT WORDS ALONE CANNOT FULLY EXPRESS. YET, I FIND MYSELF COMPELLED TO POUR OUT MY SOUL ONTO THIS PAGE, HOPING THAT IN SOME SMALL WAY, I CAN CONVEY THE DEPTH AND SINCERITY OF MY LOVE FOR YOU.

FROM THE MOMENT OUR PATHS FIRST INTERTWINED, I KNEW THAT OUR CONNECTION WAS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY. IT WAS AS IF THE STARS HAD ALIGNED, BRINGING US TOGETHER IN A COSMIC DANCE OF DESTINY. WITH EACH PASSING DAY, MY ADMIRATION FOR YOU HAS ONLY GROWN STRONGER. YOUR KINDNESS, YOUR INTELLIGENCE, YOUR INFECTIOUS LAUGHTER â€“ THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE COUNTLESS QUALITIES THAT HAVE CAPTIVATED MY HEART.

I CHERISH THE MEMORIES WE'VE CREATED TOGETHER, EACH ONE A PRECIOUS GEM IN THE TREASURE TROVE OF OUR LOVE. I VIVIDLY RECALL THE DAY WE FIRST MET, THE NERVOUS FLUTTER IN MY STOMACH AS OUR EYES LOCKED ACROSS THE CROWDED ROOM. I REMEMBER THE COUNTLESS HOURS WE'VE SPENT LOST IN CONVERSATION, OUR MINDS AND HEARTS INTERTWINING LIKE THE BRANCHES OF ANCIENT TREES. AND I WILL NEVER FORGET THE FEELING OF PURE BLISS THAT WASHED OVER ME AS YOU WHISPERED THOSE MAGICAL WORDS INTO MY EAR: "KJOL_T_ZCTS_ZV_CQKLX_NDFKZTUC."

THOSE WORDS, UTTERED WITH SUCH TENDERNESS AND SINCERITY, HAVE BECOME THE SOUNDTRACK OF MY EXISTENCE. THEY ECHO THROUGH MY HEART, REMINDING ME EVERY MOMENT OF THE INCREDIBLE GIFT I'VE BEEN GIVEN IN YOU. YOU ARE MY CONFIDANT, MY ROCK, MY SOULMATE.

I LOVE YOU FOR YOUR STRENGTH, FOR YOUR VULNERABILITY, FOR YOUR UNWAVERING BELIEF IN ME. I LOVE YOU FOR THE WAY YOU MAKE ME LAUGH, FOR THE WAY YOU CHALLENGE ME TO BE A BETTER PERSON, FOR THE WAY YOU SIMPLY LOVE ME FOR WHO I AM.

WITH EVERY BEAT OF MY HEART, I PROMISE TO CHERISH YOU, TO HONOR YOU, AND TO LOVE YOU ENDLESSLY. YOU ARE MY TODAY, MY TOMORROW, AND MY FOREVER.

WITH ALL MY LOVE,

SIEGFRIED
