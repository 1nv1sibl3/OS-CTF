When shadows grow short, and the sun stands tall,
A solstice whispers, the longest of all.
In the dance of light, where time seems to bend,
Seek the day that marks summer's extend.

Not in the digits of a calendar's fold,
But in nature's rhythm, a story is told.
On this day of warmth, where daylight beams,
The clue lies hidden, within nature's schemes.

Look to the heavens, where planets align,
A celestial clue, where mysteries entwine.
Amidst the stars, a date to discern,
When daylight lingers, and seasons turn.

Unravel this puzzle, with patience and grace,
For June's zenith, where time and space embrace.
On this solstice's eve, where mysteries gleam,
The 21st of June, in sunlight's beam.
