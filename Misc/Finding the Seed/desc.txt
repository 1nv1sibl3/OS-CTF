I just join minecraft with my friend and we're trying to see who will be the best in Minecraft. But didn't he know that i have trick under my sleeves that i just need the world seed then i can be better than him. But i can't ask him about the world seed as he will know about my trick. Can you join my server and try to find the seed.

Flag format: OSCTF{world_Seed}
ex: OSCTF{10033887773255362}
