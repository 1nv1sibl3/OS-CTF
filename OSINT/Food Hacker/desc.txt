In a digital realm where secrets are sown,
An OSINT challenge, the mystery unknown.
With clues to uncover, a journey began,
In the vast webâ€™s threads, we drew up our plan.

First, to Instagram, the profile we'd seek,
User enumeration, the task wasn't weak.
Photos and captions, likes in a row,
Hidden connections began to show.

Next, to YouTube, a new quest unfurled,
Searching for users in this vast video world.
Comments and channels, the hunt carried on,
Each clue a new puzzle from dusk until dawn.

Amongst the videos, a cake made the scene,
A hint wrapped in layers of sugary sheen.
Baking and frosting, a coded delight,
Deciphering riddles late into the night.
