Finally, I got out of the city. I took a photograph of the river because I found it so wide and big. Do you know the coordinates of where I am taking the photograph ?

Find the location (lattitude, longitude) of this area rounded to 4 decimal places and wrap it in OSCTF{}

Example: OSCTF{171.1023, -12.2024}
