I have taken a photograph of the bridge, which is so gigantic. But I'm standing at a bridge too; do you know what the bridge name is that I'm standing at and the bridge name that I took the photo of?

Flag format: OSCTF{bridge_taken_photo; bridge_standing}
if you are not vietnamese, copy the exact name.
