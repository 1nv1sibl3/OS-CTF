# The Broken Sword

The time for the reforging of the The Sword That Was Broken has come..
Elendil left a riddle, solving which will give the password, which is what you need to find :p..

Flag Format: OSCTF{valueof'flag'variable_valueof'a'variable_valueof'v2'variable} / OSCTF{flag_a_v2}

### HINTS
- Take pi as 3.14
- Sometimes it's wiser to round off numbers in Python :P
